## Why this library?

Although there are existing libraries (e.g. praw) to interact with Reddit developer's API,
there are still several drawbacks when we try to collect vast amount of data.
**gatered** tries to counter these problems to provide these features:

- No authentication (API key) is needed to access the data.
- Extra attributes is presented using the Reddit webAPI compared to the public devAPI.
- Fully Async based.
- Proxy support via [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/#http-proxying).

## Install

You can install this library easily from pypi:

```bash
# with pip
pip install gatered

# with poetry
poetry add gatered
```

## Using

The library provides easy functions to get start fast:
- `gatered.func.get_post_comments`
- `gatered.func.get_posts_with_subreddit_info`
- `gatered.func.get_posts`
- `gatered.func.get_comments`
- `gatered.func.get_pushshift_posts`

Alternatively you can directly use `gatered.client.Client` and `gatered.pushshift.PushShiftAPI` classes as your base to implement your own logics.

Errors can be handled by importing either `gatered.RequestError` or `gatered.HTTPStatusError`,
see [httpx exceptions](https://www.python-httpx.org/exceptions/) to learn more.

See [`examples/`](https://github.com/countertek/gatered/tree/main/examples/) for more examples.
Alternately, you can [fork the example repo on Replit](https://replit.com/@darekaze/gatered-examples#main.py) and play around online.
